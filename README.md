## Overfitting Detection Framework for Options Backtesting

This repository contains educational materials presented to the SMB Options Mastermind Group, focusing on advanced statistical methods for detecting overfitting in options trading strategies.

### Overview

These presentations introduce a comprehensive framework of 10 complementary measures designed to distinguish between backtested trading strategies that capture genuine market inefficiencies versus those that merely fit historical noise. The framework draws from cutting-edge research in quantitative finance, including work by Bailey, LÃ³pez de Prado, and other leaders in the field.
